## History
Since I have been to uncountable places around the world, I have grown to love to travel. I wanted to create an application where I could save the locations I have been to and blog about them. I wanted other people to comment as well and build a community of interactive travel bloggers.

## Planning
I started with sketching some wireframes for my app idea. I had a visual in my mind of how the website would physically look like and how the users would be able to navigate through the web app conveniently.

I came up with the following user stories:

- As a user I would want to view an index page when I visit the web page
- As a user I would want to sign up/register for an account
- As a user I would want to access the application by signing in to my account
- As a user I would want to have my user profile page
- As a user I would want to be able to edit my user profile page
- As a user I would want to view my locations
- As a user I would want to sign out of my account
- As a user I would want to add locations to my locations
- As a user I would want to access all locations by all users
- As a user I would want to access a single location
- As a user I would want to add a thought/post to my selected location
- As a user I would want to edit the post
- As a user I would want to delete the post along with the dependent comments
- As a user I would want to be able to add a comment to a post
- As a user I would want to be able to delete a comment to a post

## Process
I had a few roadblocks every now and then. I would say fixing undefined methods would have been my major issue throughout. I often got confused on which file I should redirect to and which objects to pass when needed. So, that took most of my time.

Nesting routes inside another nested route was something new I had to learn. I got stuck on how to apply that for quite a while. I wanted my comments to be dependent on a thought, and a thought to be dependent on a location. I had to nest my `comments` inside my `thoughts` which was inside my `location`.

Another very complex thing I had to tackle was creating my joined table. It was fairly easy but figuring out how to print what I wanted on the web page that was in that table was a challenge.

Next time I would create a project like this, I would use a gem to create users since that took a lot of my time to create.

Overall, I feel like I enjoyed the process but I would have preferred to have more time to thoroughly think about user experience as well.

## Features to build in future
- I would like to integrate a google maps API so the locations I track would be seen visually on the map.

- Add a delete feature to `My Locations`

- Have user names show up whenever a post or comment is created
